# The Sequence Data Types Have three Data TYpes
# 1 -> String
# 2-> List
# 3 ->Tuple
# A string is a sequence of characters.
#  Python treats anything inside quotes as a string.
#  This includes letters, numbers, and symbols.
#  Python has no character data type so single character is a string of length 1.
