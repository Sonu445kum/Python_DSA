# File Handling in the python:
# File handling refers to the process of performing operations on a file, such as creating,
#  opening, reading, writing and closing it through a programming interface.
#  It involves managing the data flow between the program and the file system on
#  the storage device, ensuring that data is handled safely and efficiently.

# Why We Need The File Handling in the Python :

# To store data permanently, even after the program ends.
# To access external files like .txt, .csv, .json, etc.
# To process large files efficiently without using much memory.
# To automate tasks like reading configs or saving outputs.
# To handle input/output in real-world applications and tools.
